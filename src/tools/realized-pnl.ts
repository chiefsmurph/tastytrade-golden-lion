//
// The data-pull run NDJSON is a per-cycle DECISION log and misses async fill
// confirmations, so it under-reports (and can mislabel a realized win as
// "idle"). This ledger is the truth: it matches every opening leg to a terminal
// event (Sell-to-Close OR expiration/assignment), FIFO, options and equity
// separately, and prints realized $ + %.
//
// PAGING (regression, 2026-08-15)
// This used to issue ONE request. The endpoint is paginated and caps a page at
// 250 rows, so any window longer than that was silently cut off — and the bias
// grows with the window, which is the opposite of what a reader assumes. The old
// comment here claimed a truncated fetch would be visible as "a suspiciously
// round count"; nothing actually checked, and nobody ever noticed.
//
// Two things make the fix safe rather than merely longer:
//   1. the SDK's extractResponseData throws away the `pagination` envelope, so
//      the loop cannot rely on `total-pages` being present and must also be able
//      to stop on a short page;
//   2. an API that IGNORES an unrecognised paging param returns page 1 forever,
//      and a loop that trusted the offset would concatenate duplicates into a
//      confidently doubled P&L. Every row is therefore identity-deduped, and a
//      page that adds nothing new STOPS the loop and marks the window
//      incomplete. The worst case is "we read less and say so, loudly".
//
// All matching arithmetic, response-shape parsing and the paging loop itself live
// in realized-pnl-report.ts so they can be tested without a broker session; this
// file only supplies the broker calls and prints.
