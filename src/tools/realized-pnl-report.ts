// Pure round-trip matching for the tastytrade transaction ledger. Split out of
// realized-pnl.ts so the arithmetic is testable without a broker session.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS IN THIS SHAPE (regression, 2026-08-08)
// The first version of this report understated realized loss by roughly 3×:
//
//   1. Expired-worthless contracts vanished. The open leg had no Sell-to-Close to
//      pair with, so it sat forever in the FIFO map and was never printed — a
//      −100% outcome silently left the report. Every open leg now reaches a
//      terminal state (closed / expired / explicitly still-open) and the
//      reconciliation counts prove it.
//   2. It priced trips off `value`, which excludes commissions and fees. Opening
//      costs roughly $1/contract and closing roughly $0.12, which is material at
//      this book's premium sizes. `net-value` is the default now, with the gross
//      figure kept alongside so the fee drag is visible rather than buried.
//
// Also handled, because both were hit in practice: OCC root changes across a
// corporate action (EOSE → EOSE1) must still pair, and manual EQUITY round-trips
// in these accounts must never land in an options P&L.
//
// EQUITY P&L (2026-08-15)
// Equity rows used to stop at a row count and a `netCashFlow` total, printed as
// "EXCLUDED from the options P&L". That hid real, realized, BOT-CAUSED losses:
// the EOD margin liquidation sells whatever equity is in the account, including
// shares the owner bought by hand, and four such liquidations were realized at a
// loss with no P&L anywhere in this report. `netCashFlow` is not a proxy for
// them — it conflates money spent (an open that is still held) with money lost.
//
// So equity now runs the SAME FIFO matcher as options, and every round trip is
// attributed to whoever closed it. Two rules the shared matcher must respect:
//
//   * NO ×100. `multiplier` is "1.0" for equity and "100.0" for options
//     (evaluate-position.ts:86-90). The matcher never multiplies: it prices off
//     the row's CASH (`net-value`), so the multiplier is already baked in and
//     applying one would inflate equity by 100× — the exact defect that made
//     pnl-ledger's equity rows unreadable.
//   * NO expirations. Shares do not expire, and a zero-quantity terminal row
//     (a dividend) must not be read as "close the whole position at $0". That
//     rule is correct for options and catastrophic for equity, so it is scoped
//     to options only.
