/**
 * Position provenance — who opened this position, the bot or the owner?
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. The owner hand-places "double-down" orders in the margin
 * account from the tastytrade app. Until now the bot could not tell those apart
 * from its own, so it managed them as its own (stopped them out, added to them,
 * swept them at the margin EOD liquidation) and mis-attributed their P&L to
 * itself. On 2026-08-08 a single hand-placed position was the large majority of
 * the window's loss and was initially credited to the bot.
 *
 * HOW WE KNOW. tastytrade's order API takes a client-supplied `source` string on
 * submission (`OrderRequest.source` is REQUIRED — see `core/types.ts`) and
 * echoes it back on every order read (`TastytradeOrder.source`). This bot has
 * always populated it (`order-sources.ts`). So provenance is already recorded at
 * the BROKER, on the order itself, and no local ledger is needed: the record
 * survives restarts, fresh deploys, and a wiped `data/` directory, none of which
 * a local file would. We read it back rather than re-deriving it.
 *
 * THREE DECISION STATES, NOT TWO. The decision is MANAGED / DO-NOT-TOUCH /
 * UNKNOWN, and provenance carries a fourth value so the observation log can say
 * WHY something is hands-off:
 *
 *   - `bot`            — every opening order carries one of our STRATEGY tags.      => managed
 *   - `manual`         — an opening order carries a source that is POSITIVELY
 *                        someone else's (present, non-empty, not ours).            => do-not-touch
 *   - `owner-directed` — placed by this process but on the owner's instruction
 *                        (the planned SMS path). His conviction, his exit.         => do-not-touch
 *   - `unknown`        — we could not positively identify the opener: no opening
 *                        order in the lookback window, the history call failed,
 *                        or the order came back with a blank source.               => MANAGED (as today)
 *
 * `unknown` MUST behave exactly like today (manage normally). The failure mode
 * we are guarding against is a missing/short/failed history read being read as
 * "manual" and silently disarming every stop in the account — strictly worse
 * than the problem this module solves. Every "we don't know" path in here
 * therefore resolves to `unknown`, never to a hands-off state. See the tests.
 *
 * DERIVED FROM THE SOURCE, NOT FROM MERE PRESENCE. The hands-off decision reads
 * the source CATEGORY, never "did we find a record for this order". That is what
 * lets `owner-directed` be a bot-placed order that is nonetheless hands-off, and
 * it is why adding the SMS path is a one-line change (pass the new source) rather
 * than a refactor.
 *
 * EQUITY IS COVERED. The owner hand-buys SHARES, not only contracts. An equity
 * order has no C/P suffix, so it keys as `TICKER::none` through the SAME
 * `getOrderGroupKey` path as options, and `do-not-touch-groups.ts` already
 * aliases `::none` <-> `::stock` (commit f99b67c). No second stock-detection
 * path is introduced here.
